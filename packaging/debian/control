Description: Portable C++ runtime for threads and sockets
 GNU uCommon C++ is a lightweight framework to facilitate using C++ design
 patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems
 using uClibc along with POSIX threading support. For this reason, uCommon
 disables language features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead.
 GNU uCommon C++ introduces some design patterns from Objective-C, such as
 reference counted objects, memory pools, and smart pointers.  GNU uCommon C++
 introduces new concepts for thread locking and synchronization.
